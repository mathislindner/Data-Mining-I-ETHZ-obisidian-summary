# Similarity on time series
- Two time series with same length vectors $x,x' \in \mathbb{R}^d$ could be compared with distance metrics, since they'd have the same $d$ on each time point.
	- **but** usually $u \neq u'$
	- **not** synchonous
	- **not** same time intervals

A Solution to the problem is [[Dynamic Time Warping]]
