# Similarity on graphs
## Families of similarities
### Graph isomorphism or subgraph isomorphism tests
Check whether Graph $G \space \& \space G'$  are identical
Check whether $G \in G'$ or $G' \in G$

### Graph edit distances
Cost of transforming $G \space into  \space G'$  (changing labels, adding nodes or edges)

### Topological vector
Map graph to vector and apply [[Distance Functions]]

# Examples
-  We can use the [[Wiener index]]. It's a class of similarity measure between two graphs $G \& G'$  We can do this by multiplying the [[Wiener index]] of both graphs with eachother 
$$ k(G,G') = v(G)v(G')$$
- [[Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel]]
