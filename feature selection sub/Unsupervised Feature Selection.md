# Unsupervised Feature Selection
## Problem setting
Even **without** a target variable Y , we can select features that are informative according to a **criterion of interest**

## Criteria
- **Saliency**: A feature is salient if it has a high variance or range. 
- **Entropy**: A feature has high entropy if the distribution of examples is uniform. Smoothness: A feature in a time series is smooth if its average local curvature is moderate. 
- **Density**: A feature is in a high-density region if it is connected with many other variables. 
- **Reliability**: A feature is reliable if the measurement error bars are smaller than the variability .
