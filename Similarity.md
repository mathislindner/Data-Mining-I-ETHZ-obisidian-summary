# Similarity
At the heart of mining Data is the ability to detect similarities between objects.

- [[Distance Functions]] are similarity measures on Vectors.
- We can also measure [[Similarity on sets]]
- We also have the possibility to measure [[Similarity on strings]]
- We can also measure [[Similarity on nodes]]
- We can also measure [[Similarity on time series]]
- Finally we can also measure [[Similarity on graphs]]
