# Clustering
## Clustering 
- class discovery
- group objects without knowing their class
- #unsupervised_learning 

## In practice
- Cluster images to find categories 
- Cluster patient data to find disease subtypes 
- Cluster persons in social networks to detect communities

## Different types of clustering
[[K-means clustering]]
[[Graph based clustering]]
[[Spectral clustering]]
[[Expectation Maximization clustering]]
[[Hierarchical clustering]]

## Summary

- Clustering partitions a dataset into groups of similar objects. 
- The three most popular families of clustering algorithms are 
	1) [[K-means clustering]]
	2) [[Graph based clustering]]
	3) [[Hierarchical clustering]] 
- When applying these algorithms, it is essential 
	- to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms 
	- to report the exact parameter settings used (e.g. number of clusters, distance function used).
